# Welcome to RPGHelper

Tabletop RPG is fun. An exciting mix of imagination, storytelling and teamwork 
make up the best of what fantasy has to offer. However, it can be hard for 
newcomers to fully access or grasp all of the concepts behind these games. 
Likewise it can be hard for a GM (Game Master) to manage all the information
or enforce all the rules that surface while playing. RPGHelper is a software project
aimed at creating an application that can ease the difficulty for both players
and GMs during an RPG session.

## About us
We're five college students and RPG enthusiasts.

## About the software
For this application the chosen API is [kivy](https://kivy.org/#home).
Why kivy? Well, because it's really neat. No really, it is. If you don't know
it then I strongly recommened checking out their [pong](https://kivy.org/docs/tutorials/pong.html)
tutorial and their [programming guide](https://kivy.org/docs/guide/basic.html).
If you are more of the video-watching type then check out [sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYNWK2GpwgA&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDe_l6XiJ40yGTEqIKugAdTy)
on youtube.

## Features
These are some of the features we have planned:
* Local game sessions hosted by a GM which players can join.
* In-game stats, inventory and campaign progress updating. 
    These updates can be saved and apllied to the next session, no need to start
    over.
* Dice rolling for all your dice-rolling needs.
* Character sheets with proper overview of your characters stats, skills, 
    inventory etc. No more pen and paper!(unless that's how you like to roll)
* Rules lookup
* And more to come!


## Setting up

To run the project as it is right now you need the following installed:
* A python interpreter (2.7)
* The [kivy library](https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation.html)

Then run the file 'main.py' to start the software. If you are
unfamiliar with running python scripts then read [this](http://pythoncentral.io/execute-python-script-file-shell/)
article or check out the [python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
